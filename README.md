# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Project overview

The objective of this project is to deliever a GPS tracking system that can be used to track a vehicule. The system includes a device that periodically sends its position and speed information to a remote server. The data is stored on the server where it can be accessed through a web browser for visualization.

The scope of the project is more focoused on the embedded side. In other words, the developement of the server and visualization platform are not mature. However, this work is mainly concerned with: designing a circuit, manufacturing the PCB, and developing firmware to power it, all while ensuring reliability. Below is a picture of the  produced PCB.

## 1.3 Project timeline

The realization of this project was divided into 3 main phases. 

The first phase of the project involved selecting the Microcontroller (MCU) and GPS/GPRS module, and then designing a minimalistic proof of concept using development boards.

The second phase involved designing the circuit and PCB. After the hardware design phase completed, PCB prototypes were  ordered.

In the third phase, the firmware that was initially developed during the POC stage was further refined to fit the new custom PCB and enhanced to become more reliable. 


# 2. System design
## 2.1 System architecture

The system is composed of 3 main parts: a PCB, firmware and a server. 

* The PCB circuit contains 3 major elements: 
     * A power regulation circuit based on the Texas Instruments TPS5430DDA DC-DC down converter, which is configured to safely convert any voltage between 5.5V and 20V to 3.6V. 
     * A GPS/GPRS module: SIM808, which is capable of receiving GPS signals and also connecting to a GPRS network, which means connecting to the internet.
     * An STM32 MCU: STM32F030, which is the brains of the PCB. It controls the SIM808 module via UART.

* The firmware is composed of 4 main source files
     * sim808.c contains the functions to startup, reset and send commands to the SIM808 module. 
     * gps.c contains functions to enable/disable GPS functionality and get GPS position and speed information.
     * network_functions.c contains functions to set up GPRS, send raw data through a TCP session,  publish messages to an MQTT Broker.
     * aes_encryption.c contains an implementation of the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It is used to encrypt the MQTT messages before sending them to the server.

* The server, which is an EC2 instance that has the following services running:
     * Mosquitto MQTT Broker, which is used to receive messages from the remote GPS boards.
     * An MQTT subscriber, which is a python script running as a systemd daemon responsible for processing all incoming messages to the broker and saving the Board ID, position, speed and time stamp to a database.
     * An SQL database which is PostgreSQL used to store the position data of the boards.
     * A web application utilizing Angular and Spring Boot, hosted on Apache HTTP Server, used to display the historical location of the device on a map.
